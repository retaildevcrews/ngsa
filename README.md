# NGSA

Next Generation Symmetric Apps

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Project Description

Understanding how infrastructure changes will impact application capabilities.  To that end, the NGSA effort is focused on creating a Kubernetes based application host environment in conjunction with a platform validation app that will allow continuous monitoring of the impact of changes in the hosting environment based on performance metrics results from a representative workload.

At it's culmination the project will be a collection of guidance for deployment topologies based on capability maturity, a platform validation application, and a load generation tool.

### Getting Started

The NGSA solution is a combination of a Kubernetes based infrastructure and a `Platform Validation Application`.

We suggest that you follow these steps to get started:

1. [Run the app locally](./src)
2. [Setup local Dev Cluster](./IaC/DevCluster)
3. [Deploy to Dev Cluster](./IaC/DevCluster)
