## A good user story should follow the I-N-V-E-S-T principle

- _Independent_ (from other user stories, allowing to realize them in any order);
- _Negotiable_ (omit details that would freeze the story);
- _Valuable_ (implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable by and useful to users);
- _Estimable_ (developers should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories);
- _Sizable_ (implementation fits in one iteration - if it needs many to complete, it is an EPIC);
- _Testable_ (user must be able to check the conditions of satisfaction).
