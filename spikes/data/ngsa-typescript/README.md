# Node.js and Restify Web API application

> Build a Node.js and Restify Web API application that calls a data service running on localhost:4122

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (tested on Visual Studio Codespaces, Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work with WSL1 or Cloud Shell
- Node.js 12.14.1+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- npm 6.14.4+ (comes with Node.js)
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

### Make sure the data service is running on localhost:4122

> TODO: Add instructions

### Using bash shell

> This will work from a terminal in Visual Studio Codespaces as well

```bash

# install modules in package.json file
# note: you may see output like the following, this is expected and safe to ignore
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@2.1.3 (node_modules/chokidar/node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@2.1.3: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})
# npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.13 (node_modules/fsevents):
# npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for fsevents@1.2.13: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})

npm install

# build the app

npm run build

# run the app

npm start

# optionally, set the logging level verboseness with --log-level (or -l)
# 'info' is the default

npm start -- --log-level

# alternatively you can set the following environment variables and run without command line args

export LOG_LEVEL=info # (optional)

npm start

```

wait for `Server is listening on port 4120`

### Testing the application

Open a new bash shell

> Visual Studio Codespaces allows you to open multiple shells by clicking on the `Split Terminal` icon

```bash

# test the application

# test using httpie (installed automatically in Codespaces)
http localhost:4120/version

# test using curl
curl localhost:4120/version

```

Stop the app by typing Ctrl-C or the stop button if run via F5

### Deep Testing

We use [Web Validate](https://github.com/Microsoft/webvalidate) to run deep verification tests on the Web API

If you have dotnet core sdk installed

```bash

# install Web Validate as a dotnet global tool
# this is automatically installed in CodeSpaces
dotnet tool install -g webvalidate

# make sure you are in the root of the repository

# run the validation tests
# validation tests are located in the TestFiles directory
cd TestFiles

webv -s localhost:4120 -f baseline.json

# there may be a validation error on the /healthz/ietf endpoint test
#   json: status: warn : Expected: pass
# the "warn" status indicates a slower than normal response time
# this is OK and will occasionally occur

# benchmark.json is a 300 request test that covers the entire API

# cd to root of repo
cd ..

```

Test using Docker image

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repository

# run the validation tests
# mount the local TestFiles directory to /app/TestFiles in the container
# 172.17.0.1 is the docker host IP
docker run -it --rm -v TestFiles:/app/TestFiles retaildevcrew/webvalidate -s http://172.17.0.1:4120 -f baseline.json

# there may be a validation error on the /healthz/ietf endpoint test
#   json: status: warn : Expected: pass
# the "warn" status indicates a slower than normal response time
# this is OK and will occasionally occur

# benchmark.json is a 300 request test that covers the entire API

```
