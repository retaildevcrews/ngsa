# Spikes Projects

## Overview

The spikes folder contains projects and files that were created as part of our exploratory work.  We keep the spikes work for future reference as not all spikes are immediately useful and in some cases parts of spike work proves to be invaluable for future tasks.

## Spikes ToC

1. [fluentd](./fluentd) - investigation into the use of fluentd instead of a custom sidecar for log collection and export
2. [Grafana <- Azure Monitor](./grafana-az-monitor) - work to surface Azure Monitor data into a Grafana dashboard
3. [Istio-Multicluster](./istio-multicluster) - work to understand how to operation an Istio Service Mesh across multiple clusters
4. [logapp](./logapp) - Simple C# app that logs errors to stderr used when working on log handling
5. [sidecar](./sidecar/) - deployment YAML for deprecated custom sidecar log handler
