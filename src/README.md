# Source Code Hierarchy

- ngsa-typescript
  - typescript version of the ngsa application
- ngsa-csharp
  - C# version of the ngsa application

## Running the Applications

1. To reduce setup complexity we suggest that you follow the directions for running the application in In-memory mode as detailed in the [NGSA App Readme](./ngsa-csharp/README.md)
2. Once the app is running locally you may run tests against it using [Loderunner](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/ngsa/blob/main/src/loderunner/README.md)
